      ESP32 button blink LED experiment
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      The "ESP32 button blink LED experiment" is a foundational electronics
      project that demonstrates how microcontrollers interact with external
      components such as buttons and LEDs. In this experiment, the ESP32
      microcontroller is programmed to detect when a button is pressed and, in
      response, control the blinking of an LED.
    </p>

    <strong>Theory Behind the Experiment:</strong>
    <p>
      The ESP32 has digital input and output pins. A button is connected to one
      of the input pins, and an LED is connected to an output pin. When the
      button is pressed, the ESP32 reads a change in voltage at the input pin
      (from HIGH to LOW or vice versa, depending on wiring). The microcontroller
      then executes code to turn the LED on and off in a blinking pattern. This
      involves using basic programming concepts such as conditional statements,
      loops, and timing functions (like delays).
    </p>

    <strong>What the Experiment Entails:</strong>

    <ul>
      <li>Wiring a button and LED to the ESP32’s GPIO pins.</li>
      <li>Writing code to detect button presses.</li>
      <li>
        Programming the ESP32 to blink the LED when the button is pressed.
      </li>
      <li>Testing and observing the response.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Importance in the Real World:</strong>
    <p>
      This experiment introduces key concepts in embedded systems and IoT
      (Internet of Things). Button-controlled LEDs are used in countless
      devices, from simple toys to complex industrial machines. Understanding
      how to read inputs and control outputs is essential for designing
      interactive systems, user interfaces, and automation solutions. Mastery of
      these basics enables further exploration into sensors, actuators, and
      wireless communication, forming the foundation for smart devices and
      modern electronics.

      <strong>ESP32 blink experiment</strong>
    </h2>
    <br />
    <!-- ...existing code... -->
    <strong>Theory Behind the Experiment:</strong>
    <p>
      The ESP32 blink experiment demonstrates the basic principle of digital
      output control using a microcontroller. The ESP32 is programmed to send
      voltage signals to an LED connected to one of its GPIO pins, causing the
      LED to turn on and off at set intervals. This is achieved by configuring
      the pin as an output and using code to alternate its state between HIGH
      and LOW, typically with a delay in between. The experiment introduces
      fundamental programming concepts such as loops and timing functions, which
      are essential for controlling hardware.
    </p>
    <strong>What the Experiment Entails:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Connecting an LED to one of the ESP32’s GPIO pins.</li>
      <li>Writing code to set the pin as an output.</li>
      <li>
        Programming the ESP32 to turn the LED on and off repeatedly using
        delays.
      </li>
      <li>Observing the LED blink as a result of the program.</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Importance in the Real World:</strong>
    <p>
      The ESP32 blink experiment is a foundational exercise for anyone learning
      embedded systems or electronics. Blinking an LED is often the first step
      in understanding how microcontrollers interact with external devices. This
      knowledge is crucial for developing more complex systems, such as
      automated lighting, status indicators, and user interfaces. Mastery of
      digital output control forms the basis for building smart devices and
      integrating sensors and actuators in real-world applications.
