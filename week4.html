      <bold>ESP 32, Potentimeter LED experiment</bold>
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      <strong>Theory Behind the Experiment:</strong><br />
      The ESP32, potentiometer LED experiment demonstrates how a microcontroller
      can read analog input values and use them to control an output device. In
      this experiment, a potentiometer is connected to one of the ESP32’s analog
      input pins, and an LED is connected to a digital output pin. The ESP32
      reads the varying voltage from the potentiometer, which changes as the
      knob is turned, and uses this value to adjust the brightness of the LED.
      This is typically achieved by mapping the analog input value to a PWM
      (pulse-width modulation) signal that controls the LED’s intensity.<br /><br />
      <strong>What the Experiment Entails:</strong><br />
      - Connecting a potentiometer to the ESP32’s analog input pin.<br />
      - Connecting an LED to a digital output pin.<br />
      - Writing code to read the potentiometer’s value and use it to set the LED
      brightness.<br />
      - Observing how turning the potentiometer changes the LED’s brightness.<br /><br />
      <strong>Importance in the Real World:</strong><br />
      This experiment is important because it introduces the concept of
      analog-to-digital conversion and real-time control of devices.
      Potentiometers are commonly used in user interfaces for adjusting volume,
      brightness, or other settings. Understanding how to read analog inputs and
      control outputs is essential for developing interactive systems, such as
      dimmable lights, motor speed controllers, and sensor-based automation in
      smart devices.

      <bold>ESP32 fading LED experiment </bold>
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      <strong>Theory Behind the Experiment:</strong><br />
      The ESP32 fading LED experiment demonstrates how to create a smooth
      transition of an LED’s brightness using pulse-width modulation (PWM). In
      this experiment, the ESP32 controls an LED by varying the duty cycle of
      the PWM signal sent to the LED. By gradually increasing and decreasing the
      duty cycle, the LED appears to fade in and out, creating a visually
      appealing effect.<br /><br />
      <strong>What the Experiment Entails:</strong><br />
      - Connecting an LED to one of the ESP32’s PWM-capable output pins.<br />
      - Writing code to implement a loop that changes the PWM duty cycle over
      time.<br />
      - Observing the LED’s brightness change smoothly as it fades in and
      out.<br /><br />
      <strong>Importance in the Real World:</strong><br />
      This experiment is important because it illustrates how to control light
      intensity using PWM, a technique widely used in lighting systems,
      displays, and visual effects. Fading LEDs are commonly found in decorative
      lighting, automotive lighting, and user interfaces. Understanding how to
      implement fading effects enhances skills in creating dynamic and engaging
      user experiences in electronic projects.
