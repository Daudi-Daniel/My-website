      <bold>ESP32, POSITIONAL (360) servo motor experiment</bold>
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      <strong>Theory Behind the Experiment:</strong><br />
      The ESP32, positional (360) servo motor experiment demonstrates how a
      microcontroller can precisely control the angular position of a servo
      motor. A positional servo motor receives pulse-width modulation (PWM)
      signals from the ESP32, which determine the angle to which the motor shaft
      rotates. By varying the width of the pulses, the ESP32 can set the servo
      to specific positions within its range, typically up to 360 degrees for
      full rotation servos.<br /><br />
      <strong>What the Experiment Entails:</strong><br />
      - Connecting a positional (360) servo motor to the ESP32’s GPIO pins.<br />
      - Writing code to generate PWM signals for controlling the servo’s
      position.<br />
      - Sending commands from the ESP32 to move the servo to desired angles.<br />
      - Observing and testing the servo’s response to different PWM values.<br /><br />
      <strong>Importance in the Real World:</strong><br />
      This experiment is important because positional servo motors are widely
      used in robotics, automation, and control systems where precise movement
      is required. Applications include robotic arms, camera gimbals, and
      automated mechanisms. Understanding how to control a servo motor with a
      microcontroller like the ESP32 is fundamental for building interactive
      devices and systems that require accurate positioning and motion control.

      <bold>ESP32, CONTINUOUS servo motor experiment</bold>
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      <strong>Theory Behind the Experiment:</strong><br />
      The ESP32, continuous servo motor experiment explores how a
      microcontroller can control the speed and direction of a continuous
      rotation servo motor. Unlike positional servos, continuous servos rotate
      indefinitely in either direction. The ESP32 sends pulse-width modulation
      (PWM) signals to the servo, where the width of the pulse determines both
      the direction and speed of rotation. Neutral pulses stop the motor, while
      wider or narrower pulses cause it to rotate clockwise or counterclockwise
      at varying speeds.<br /><br />
      <strong>What the Experiment Entails:</strong><br />
      - Connecting a continuous servo motor to the ESP32’s GPIO pins.<br />
      - Writing code to generate PWM signals for controlling speed and
      direction.<br />
      - Sending commands from the ESP32 to start, stop, and change the rotation
      of the servo.<br />
      - Observing and testing the servo’s response to different PWM values.<br /><br />
      <strong>Importance in the Real World:</strong><br />
      Continuous servo motors are widely used in robotics, automation, and
      mobile platforms where continuous movement is needed, such as wheels or
      conveyor belts. Understanding how to control these motors with a
      microcontroller like the ESP32 is essential for building robots, automated
      vehicles, and systems that require variable speed and direction control.

      <strong>ESP32, CONTINUOUS STEPPED servo motor experiment</strong>
    </h2>
    <br />
    <p>
      <strong>Theory Behind the Experiment:</strong><br />
      The ESP32, continuous stepped servo motor experiment demonstrates how a
      microcontroller can control a servo motor to move in discrete steps rather
      than smooth, continuous motion. By sending carefully timed pulse-width
      modulation (PWM) signals, the ESP32 can command the servo to rotate a
      fixed amount with each signal, creating a stepped movement effect. This
      approach is useful for applications that require precise incremental
      positioning or controlled rotation in stages.<br /><br />
      <strong>What the Experiment Entails:</strong><br />
      - Connecting a continuous stepped servo motor to the ESP32’s GPIO pins.<br />
      - Writing code to generate PWM signals that move the servo in defined
      steps.<br />
      - Sending commands from the ESP32 to control the number and size of
      steps.<br />
      - Observing and testing the servo’s response to different step
      commands.<br /><br />
      <strong>Importance in the Real World:</strong><br />
      Stepped servo control is important in robotics, automation, and machinery
      where precise incremental movement is needed, such as in conveyor systems,
      pick-and-place machines, and camera sliders. Understanding how to
      implement stepped motion with a microcontroller like the ESP32 enables the
      creation of devices that require accurate, repeatable positioning and
      controlled movement for complex tasks.
