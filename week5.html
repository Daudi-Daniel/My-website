 <p>
  <strong>What Are Sensors?</strong><br>
  Sensors are electronic devices that detect and respond to changes in the environment by converting physical phenomena—such as light, temperature, pressure, humidity, or motion—into electrical signals. These signals can then be measured, processed, and used to trigger actions or provide information.<br><br>
  <strong>Types, Functions, and Applications:</strong><br>
  There are many types of sensors, each designed for specific functions:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Temperature sensors</b> – measure heat and are used in climate control, appliances, and industrial processes.</li>
    <li><b>Light sensors</b> – detect light intensity, used in automatic lighting, smartphones, and cameras.</li>
    <li><b>Motion sensors</b> – sense movement, used in security systems, gaming, and robotics.</li>
    <li><b>Pressure sensors</b> – measure force or pressure, found in automotive, medical, and industrial equipment.</li>
    <li><b>Humidity sensors</b> – monitor moisture levels, used in weather stations and HVAC systems.</li>
    <li><b>Proximity sensors</b> – detect the presence of nearby objects, used in touch screens and parking sensors.</li>
    <li><b>Ultrasonic sensors</b> – measure distance using sound waves, used in robotics and automation.</li>
  </ul>
  Sensors are used in a wide range of applications, including smart homes, industrial automation, healthcare devices, environmental monitoring, robotics, and consumer electronics.<br><br>
  <strong>Use with Embedded Systems:</strong><br>
  Embedded systems, such as microcontrollers (ESP32, Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino), use sensors to gather data from the environment. The microcontroller reads the sensor’s output (analog or digital), processes the information, and performs actions like turning on an LED, activating a motor, or sending data to a display or network. This integration enables real-time monitoring, control, and automation.<br><br>
  <strong>Why Sensors Are Key and Important:</strong><br>
  Sensors are fundamental to modern technology and automation. They enable devices to interact with and adapt to their surroundings, making technology more responsive, efficient, and user-friendly. Without sensors, embedded systems would not be able to perceive or react to changes, limiting their usefulness. Understanding sensors and how to use them is essential for designing intelligent systems and advancing innovation in countless fields.

      <strong>Theory Behind the Experiment:</strong><br />
      Ultrasonic sensors work by emitting high-frequency sound waves and
      measuring the time it takes for the echo to return after bouncing off an
      object. The sensor calculates the distance to the object based on the
      speed of sound and the time interval between sending and receiving the
      pulse. This principle is known as echolocation and is commonly used in
      nature by animals like bats and dolphins.<br /><br />
      <strong>What the Experiment Entails:</strong><br />
      - Connecting an ultrasonic sensor to a microcontroller’s input and output
      pins.<br />
      - Writing code to trigger the sensor and measure the echo time.<br />
      - Calculating the distance to an object using the measured time and the
      speed of sound.<br />
      - Displaying or using the distance data for further applications.<br /><br />
      <strong>Importance in the Real World:</strong><br />
      Ultrasonic sensors are widely used for distance measurement, object
      detection, and automation. They are found in applications such as robotics
      (for obstacle avoidance), automotive parking sensors, liquid level
      measurement, and security systems. Understanding how ultrasonic sensors
      work and how to interface them with microcontrollers is essential for
      developing smart, responsive systems in modern technology.
